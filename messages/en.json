    "intro": "I'm Diep Tran, a person who loves doing things artistically, and always looks for a new way to create things rather than follows a traditional way.",
    "1": " After a few years of trying different kinds of photography, my passion became food and still life photography. With these kinds of photography, I am able to arrange the scene and create a story for each photo relative to the actual situation at the time.",
    "2": "Like other women, I like to make friends with people, love shopping, and having coffee with friends. Since my passion for food photography became stronger I started to learn how to cook yummy dishes that look interesting as well as to put my creative arrangement touch into those dishes and photograph them.",
    "3": "I also started writing recipes to share my way of making and presenting food. These recipes are not from professional chefs but from a person who loves cooking with creativity in her own way to create a dish that not also tastes yummy but looks inspiring for photography.â€‹",
    "4": "My blog is to share my experiences of photographing food, how to master the light, a good composition so that the food has to appear as mouthwatering food in the photos. If you are interested in working with me, please contact me."
